Please note, that the number of beds being calculated and accounted for is not calculated in the new code, will add it by Wednesday (13th September) The second part of the model deals with input from patients needing admission as an inflow

Reproduced all the results as per the stella model
things to remember, seed values added as radnom.seed(10) to be removed for various simulations and comparisons of all the varying results. it has only been added for reproducibility. 
Delay, RAMP and Smoothing to be replaced with the algorithm best suited for the NHS 

Divided into classes for ease of access and scalability
